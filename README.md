# tacx-ant
This project will enable a Windows or Linux PC to broadcast ANT+ data via a dongle from a Tacx trainer connected to it via USB. This can be either be from a standalone PC broadcasting to a PC or tablet running e.g. Zwift or Trainerroad, or from a Windows PC already running Zwift/ Trainerroad (this PC will therefore require two ANT+ dongles)
